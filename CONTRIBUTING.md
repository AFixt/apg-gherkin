# Contributing

Below, you'll find our guidelines for contributing to this repository. Your involvement is crucial in making this project more effective and accessible.

## Workflow

1. **Fork and Create a Branch**: If you're ready to contribute, start by forking the repository and then creating a new branch in your fork. This branch should be named descriptively, based on the issue you're addressing.

2. **Focus on a Specific Issue**: Each contribution should be focused on solving a specific issue that has been logged in the repository's issue tracker. Before starting work, ensure the issue is not already being addressed by another contributor.

3. **Making Changes**: With your branch ready, you can start making your changes. Please ensure your code adheres to the existing coding standards and that you're committing your changes regularly.

4. **Write Meaningful Commit Messages**: Your commit messages should clearly describe what has been changed or added. This helps maintainers understand your changes better and speeds up the review process.

5. **Pull Requests**: Once you're satisfied with your changes, create a pull request against the `develop` branch of the original repository. Your pull request should detail what the changes are and reference the issue it resolves.

6. **Code Review**: The maintainers will review your pull request and may suggest changes or improvements. This is a collaborative process, so constructive feedback and discussion are encouraged.

7. **Merge**: Once your pull request is approved, a maintainer will merge it into the `develop` branch.

## Logging Issues

If you're not comfortable with Git or coding, you can still contribute significantly by logging issues. Whether it's a bug you've found or a feature suggestion, your feedback is valuable.

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, please check the repository's issue tracker to ensure the issue hasn't already been reported.

2. **Create a New Issue**: If your issue is new, go ahead and create it. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, the expected outcome, and any other relevant information.

3. **Engage in the Discussion**: Once your issue is logged, you might receive comments or questions from the maintainers or other contributors. Engaging in this dialogue helps clarify the issue and guides its resolution.
